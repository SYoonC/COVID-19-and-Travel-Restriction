# COVID-19-and-Travel-Restriction
COVID-19 has changed every scheme of traveling. 
Not only limited to traveling, crossing a border became increasingly difficult.  

Fortunately, the world has turned to be better. 
With an increasing supply (and indeed, demand), vaccinations are now being produced and each country is considering easing its border restriction.  

However this does not necessarily mean all borders are open and people who must cross a border have eased their concern. 
Therefore this project will show  COVID-19 situation of each selected country Border control situation of each selected country .

<H2>Aim</H2>
Create a website (PC and Mobile compatible) or an app which shows data visualisation of each country’s COVID-19 data and travel restriction.
And those countries to be included are ;
